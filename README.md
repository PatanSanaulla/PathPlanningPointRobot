-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To RUN Dijkstra Point:\
```>>> python Dijkstra_point.py```

Enter the Initial Points (x,y) Position: \
Example (for 5,5): 5 5\
Enter the Goal Points (x,y) Position: \
Example (for 200,100): 200 100\


OUTPUT: \
start time: (time of the start of generation)\
Message: (Either reached message or an Error Message)\
If reached, Gives the infomation of the Step and cost to come. \
End time: (time when the path has been found and shown)\
Animation: An Animated Graph is shown with 



To RUN Dijkstra Rigid:\
```>> python Dijkstra_rigid.py```

Enter the Initial Points (x,y) Position: \
Example (for 5,5): 5 5\
Enter the Goal Points (x,y) Position: \
Example (for 200,100): 200 100\
Enter the Radius of the robot: \
Enter the Clearance of the robot: \



OUTPUT:\
start time: (time of the start of generation)\
Message: (Either reached message or an Error Message)\
If reached, Gives the infomation of the Step and cost to come. \
End time: (time when the path has been found and shown)
